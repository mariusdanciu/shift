Shift is a pure stateless and asynchronous web toolkit written in Scala, being inspired by LiftWeb.

Briefly:

- Uses state monads to process requests, specify routes etc.
- Uses state monads to propagate state between snippets in html templates.
- Lightweight template engine that supports merging templates leading to vast reuse of common templates
- Responses are async by design
