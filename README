Shift is a pure stateless and asynchronous web toolkit written in Scala and being inspired by LiftWeb.

- Uses state monads to process requests.
- Uses state monads to propagate state between snippets in html templates (snippets Ã  la LiftWeb ... but lifted).
- Flexible way to invoke snippets from HTML (you can have your own representation)
- Responses are async
- Uses netty by default for HTTP stack
